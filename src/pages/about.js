          <strong>
            I'm a web developer living in the Greater Philadelphia Area with my
            wife and our goldendoodle, August. I enjoy hiking, tabletop games,
            video games, reading, and learning new technologies.

          This wasn't always what I planned to do. I grew up Huntingdon Valley,
          PA and went to the University of Pittsburgh. I earned a B.A. with
          majors in English Literature and English Writing (Fiction), intending
          to teach secondary English. The Master's program I got into was rather
          expensive, and the deadline came shortly after Pittsburgh Public
          Schools laid of about 1/3 of its teaching staff, so I decided to hold
          off. I worked as a youth director at a synagogue before my
          then-girlfriend and I moved back home to Philadelphia for a year where
          I got into another, thriftier Master's program. Philadelphia,
          similarly, cleaned house - this time, I believe it was 1/4 of their
          schoolteachers. Education, it seemed, was not the path for me. I took
          assorted jobs and casually began to tinker with coding courses, trying
          to better myself and sate a longstanding interest.

          It turns out that I would rediscover my path in Omaha, NE, where we
          moved so my girlfriend could attend Creighton University's School of
          Dentistry. I seized opportunities to take programming courses at the
          local community college and volunteer with the local CoderDojo. I
          ended up landing my first development job with Omaha Media Group and
          enrolled at Bellevue University in their Software Development
          Accelerated Cohort program. In our last year and a half or so of our
          time in Omaha, I earned my B.S. in Software Development, gained
          invaluable experience in web development, and proposed to my now-wife.
          As much as we adored the city of Omaha, we decided to uproot our lives
          to move to Nashville, TN and try something new.

          We settled in and spent a year in Tennessee. She worked in a dental
          practice and I bounced around a bit before finding a home at the State
          of Tennessee. We got married, honeymooned in France, and plotted out
          our next move. After several significant discussions, we decided to
          come back home to Philadelphia to be closer to family and friends. In
          the meantime, I've found some cool projects to work on and I'm
          continuing to learn new things. I'm working on making more projects
          with React, learning to write test-driven JS, and more. I'm passionate
          about creating excellent tools and technologies to support my hobbies
          of tabletop and video gaming. I'm always interested in side projects,
          so be sure to contact me if there's something you think I could help
          with!
